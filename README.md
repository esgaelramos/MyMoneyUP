MyMoneyUP is a django project for track your assets, and send a
email with a report and a newsletter with the progress and performance of 
that assets. Check in [mymoneyup.tech](https://mymoneyup.tech) :|

```

Create migrations

Create the file .env

+ Now! Stop! We need create a file .env in the root of project, and add the 
same variables of .env.example file, click here for check what mean each 
variable: [File of Variables](#file-of-variables).

#### Create the database in PostgreSQL

## File of Variables
In this file we have the variables of environment, obviously, this file is
ignored by git, because we don't want to share our secrets with the world.

### The fundamental variables are:
+ SECRET_KEY = 'a random key for Django security'
+ DEBUG = True/False (use True only in development)
+ PATH_CONFIG_YAML = 'path of config.yaml file in the root of project'
+ DOMAIN_DEV = 'domain of development (in local is "127.0.0.1")'

### DataBase Variables:
Remember, first [create the database in PostgreSQL](#create-the-database-in-postgresql), and then, add these variables!
+ DBNAME_DEV = 'name of database'
+ DBUSER_DEV = 'user of database (default is postgres)'
+ DBPASSWORD_DEV = 'password of database'
+ DBHOST_DEV = 'host of database (default is localhost)'
+ DBPORT_DEV = 'port of database (default is '5432')'

### More variables (not fundamental):
+ EMAIL_USER_DEV = 'from (gmail) for send emails'
+ EMAIL_PASSWORD_DEV = 'obtained from gmail for not secure apps!'
