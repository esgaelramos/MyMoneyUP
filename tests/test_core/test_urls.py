URL Tests for the core project

This module contains unit tests that ensure the correct resolution of URLs
within the core project. The primary focus is to guarantee that expected paths
resolve to the correct views, ensuring the stability of user-facing routes.

Note:
- For URL resolving tests, use the actual URL string (e.g., '/login/')
instead of the named URL pattern.
